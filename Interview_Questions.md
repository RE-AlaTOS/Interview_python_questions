### Q2. Math Module and User Input

Write a Python program that calculates the area of a circle. The radius is input by the user.

---

---

### Q3. Loops and Conditionals

Write a Python program to print the numbers 1 to 99 in ascending order line by line. However, if the number is divisible by 3, it should be replaced with "Fizz". If the number is divisible by 5, it should be replaced with "Buzz". If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, it should be replaced with "FizzBuzz".

For example, the output should look like:
```
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
...
```

### Q4. Recursion or Loops

Write a Python function that can calculate the factorial of a number.

---

---

### Q5. String Operations

Write a Python function that takes a string and returns a string where every character is duplicated. For example, `"Hello"` becomes `"HHeelllloo"`.

---

---

### Q6. Dictionaries

Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers and returns a dictionary where the keys are the numbers, and the values are tuples containing the square and cube of these numbers.

---

---

### Q7. Classes

Write a Python class named `Rectangle`. This class should have two attributes: `width` and `height`. Add two methods: `area()` and `perimeter()` that will return the corresponding values.

---

---

### Q8. Long Question 1

Write a Python program for a number guessing game. An integer will be randomly generated between 1 and 100, and the user will be prompted to make guesses. If the user guesses correctly, the game ends. Otherwise, the user will be informed whether their guess is too high or too low, and the game continues.

Optional:
- Output the total number of guesses at the end.

- The range of numbers is input by the user at the start.
    
- Check if the input range of numbers is invalid (e.g. 100 to 0). If so, prompt the user to input values again.

---

### Q9. Long Question 2

Write a Python program to return the real roots of a quadratic equation ($ax^2 + bx + c = 0$). The coefficients will be input by the user.

Optional:
- The program should be able to handle cases where $a$ is zero and where $a, b$ is zero.

- The program can find the complex roots as well.

### Q10. Long Question 3

Write a Python program to calculate the sum of the digits of a given input integer.

Optional:
- Calculate the digital root of the input integer.
